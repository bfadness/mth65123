    "Use Lagrange finite elements to approximately solve the boundary value problem using the weak formulation of Exercise 2. You will need  complex-valued Lagrange finite element functions (available in NGSolve using the `complex` keyword in `ng.H1(...)`). Your code should take $k$ and the  number of elements as input parameters. Calculate the exact solution   ``by hand'' and compare it with your numerical  solution. How do the numerical solutions change as you vary $k$?"

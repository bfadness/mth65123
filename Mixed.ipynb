Block matrices expect block vectors when asked to perform matrix multiplication. I'll warn you that it's not a good idea to directly perform a generic vector operation between a block vector object and a regular NGSolve vector. (In some cases NGSolve will raise an exception and will not allow you to do so.) Also, when you work with block vectors, it is a good idea to ensure that you have variable names bound to its individual component vectors in your python workspace.  Here is an exercise to get some practice on working with the `BlockMatrix` structures and with matrix-vector products in NGSolve. "

    "One way to obtain the matrix of $\\curl$ is to take each shape function in $N_{h, p}$, apply curl, and then expand the result in terms of the shape functions of the DG space. However, since the application of `curl` in NGSolve does not output an object in the DG space, we need to do an additional step to make this computationally feasible. One idea is to use the `Set` method of the DG space: if you provide it a function that you know should be contained within the DG space, then the `Set` method interpolates it with zero error, creating the interpolant as a `GridFunction` object. Such objects can be queried for their vector of coefficients of basis expansions, which become entries of the curl matrix. This idea is implemented below."

However, we punched two holes in our domain, so our domain is not simply connected. Hence we cannot assert that all curl-free functions on our domain are gradients. The number of holes in a two dimensional domain is a topological invariant called the second Betti number $b_1$. (The first Betti number $b_0$ is the number of connected components of the domain, which is clearly 1 for our example.) A deep theorem of de Rham connects the topological  Betti numbers to  quantities arising from smooth function spaces (namely the dimensions of certain cohomology spaces arising from spaces of infinitely smooth functions).  We are now going to see that the number $b_1$ arises very simply and naturally from the above not-so-smooth, but carefully-chosen  spaces of vector finite elements."

    "Now that we have the right hand side prepared, we can solve for $A$. Of course, we must deal with the same non-uniqueness problem we encountered in Example 1. This time we illustrate another technique to overcome the problem. Instead of orthogonalizing $A$ against gradients, we use an NGSolve facility to create an $H(\\curl)$-conforming space from which most gradient shape functions have been removed. This together with the addition of a small term that prevents the system from having a null space is a reasonable practical solution. Even if  it may not be as mathematically satisfying as the previous technique, it has the advantage that we can solve a larger size problem with a simple iterative solver like conjugate gradients."
